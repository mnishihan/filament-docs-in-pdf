## Why PDF version?

As a full stack web (and backend service) developer, I often need to create api & admin interface for small to medium web applications in the shortest possible time. And due to expressive syntax & the rapid development tools provided, I find [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) to be very useful for this purpose.

Also, for myself I sometimes intentionally turn off internet while writing code to focus on work to meet deadline. During that isolated time, I need offline versions of documentation of various tools, libraries and framework. Even though, for most of the other tools, libraries & frameworks offline documentation is available, for Laravel it was never true. To solve this issue, few years back I created & maintained offline downloadable documentation of all Laravel versions available then and published in [laravel-docs-in-pdf](https://github.com/mnishihan/laravel-docs-in-pdf) through scripted processing on the markdown files from the [Laravel documentation repo](https://github.com/laravel/docs) available in github.

Nowadays, it is almost impractical to start working in a Laravel project without installing [Filament](https://filamentphp.com) packages. And again, I feel the same issue of no offline documentation for [Filament](https://filamentphp.com). ☹️

As a result, I've decided to create offline (PDF) documentation for [Filament](https://filamentphp.com) and here is the result.

> In [filament-docs-in-pdf](https://github.com/mnishihan/filament-docs-in-pdf) repo, you can always find up-to-date PDF files corresponding to documentation for each version of [Filament](https://filamentphp.com) and download copies for offline use. If you find these PDF documentation files useful and want to show some support, please give [the repo](https://github.com/mnishihan/filament-docs-in-pdf) a star and share with your social/professional network.
